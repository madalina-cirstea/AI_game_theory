# AI_game_theory
Python implementation of two games (colored blocks and checkers) using AI algorithms such as Minimax algorithm and its optimized version (Alpha-beta) and A-star search algorithm.

## Colored blocks 
heuristic graph exploration algorithm (A-star search)

## Checkers
Minimax algorithm (Alpha-beta optimized version)
